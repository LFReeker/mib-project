Welcome to the Git repository of our group in the Mobile Intelligence and Business course of CMU. 

In this project, we conduct a social network analysis and spatial trajectory analysis of on a dataset consisting of 58 million calls, gathered from the area of the Chinees city of Tai'an. Furthermore, we designed and created an interactive dashboard which you and other users can use by yourself. With this dashboard, we are able to show the different sequential analysis we performed while maintaining user interactivity and flexibility. With this, we think that one is able to understand and digest the different (outcomes of the) analysis even more.

The git repository consists of a folder *code* which contains the code for preprocessing of the data, the analysis and other code for support of the analysis. The folder *dashboard* contains the code to build the interactive dashboard. At last, the folder *plot* consists of the several plots and images created from the analysis for the report.

For this project we drafted a report, final presentation, datasets and a dashboard.
